. Shell (sh, bash, zsh)
. Text Editor (vim, neovim, vs code, sublime text)
. Text Specification, see link:../text[text]
. Version control (git, github, gitlab)
. Programming language, see link:../code[code]

=== Linux

.Linux directory structure
|===

*Type special characters*

Perhaps to write a dash, in linux there is a way to write unicode symbols.

. press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+U]
. type the unicode code, perhaps kbd:[2,0,1,4]
. press kbd:[Space]

== Desktop Environment

. GNOME
. MATE
. XFCE

I am planning to return to GNOME.

== Shell

. Bash

I am planning to switch to zsh.

== Text Editor

. NetBeans
. Sublime Text
. Notepad++
. VS Code
. Vim
. Neovim

Moving the screen with kbd:[Up]/kbd:[Down] (normal editors) or with kbd:[J]/kbd:[K] (vim) is not efficient.
However we all do it sometimes.
Why not to set shorter stroke rate so the screen moves faster.

.Set key stroke rate
[source, shell]
----
xset r rate 200 20
----

*Remap Caps lock to Escape*

If case you wan to use vim / neovim / vi shell mode.
I can not enough recommend you to remap caps lock key to escape.


== Terminal

.Terminal shortcuts
|===
| shortcut        | action

| kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T]    | Open new tab.
| kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+W]    | Close current tab.
| kbd:[Ctrl+PgUp]       | Go to upper (left) tab. kbd:[PgDn] goes to the right tab.
| kbd:[Ctrl+1]          | Go to tab 1 (works for all numbers).

=== Eye Strain

Following settings might lower your eye strain.

. Use light themes instead of dark themes.
    * It's way less cool and that's the point _wink_.
. Set exponential brightness step count in power manager.
    * It allows you to set the display really dim during nights.
. Use a software which lowers the screen temperature.

A little exception is *netrw* inside of neovim.

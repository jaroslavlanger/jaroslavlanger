== Introduction

**The terminal enviroment**

Once the terminal is open, what you see is the Command-line interface (CLI). On the left to the cursor is the prompt, which prompts you to take action.

Usually the prompts tells a name of a current user, the name of the machine (hostname) and the location where the user is relatively to the machine (path). Typicaly it also shows, whether the logged user is a normal user ($) or superuser (#).

Example of common appearance could be:

[,console]
----
USER_NAME@HOSTNAME:PATH$
----

### Shell principle - commands and keywords

Shell is a scripting language, so you can do basically anything as in any other programming language. However shell is also a command language so most of the time you will run commands that someone already made for you. Once you will be able to use these commands, you will probably combine them into shell scripts.

**What happens when I type something to the terminal**

Many words have special meaning. Some words are reserved for the shell programming language, they are called **keywords**, multiple words are **built-in commands** and usually there are also many **executable commands** prepared for you.

### Comments - tell shell to ignore it

Everything between a hash sign `#` and the end of the line is ignored. So it is perfect for making comments or remarks.

```sh
# anything written here is ignored
```

Sometimes I will use the `#` sign to show you the command's output. It is ignored, so it does not matter if you copy-past the lines with it or not.

.Motivation to use the terminal
[%collapsible]
====
.How many visible files are under this directory?
----
find . -type f | grep -v '/\.' | wc -l
----

NOTE: You can read it from the back as "Count how many (`+wc -l+`) visible (`+grep -v '/\.'+`) files are under this directory (`+find . -type f+`)".

|===
| Text        | Explanation

| `+find+`    | Command find, searches for files and directories.
| `+.+`       | `+.+` means "current path", in find "search from current path".
| `+-type f+` | find's argument to search only files.
| `+\|+`      | Pipe, passes command's output as an input to the next command.
| `+grep+`    | Command grep, filters out lines which don't match given pattern.
| `+-v+`      | grep's argument to filter the matching lines and keep others.
| `+'/\.'+`   | Pattern for a "hidden" file or directory (begins with a dot).
| `+\|+`      | Pipe again.
| `+wc+`      | Command to count lines, words and bytes.
| `+-l+`      | wc's argument to output only the number of lines.
|===

====

**command exit**

`exit` command terminates current shell. If you run only one shell, it also close the terminal. Shell is case-sensitive, so while `exit` followed by enter closes the terminal, `Exit` only tells you that `Exit: command not found`.

```sh
Exit
# Exit: command not found
```

**command echo**

Let's start with printing "Hello world!". Type `echo Hello world!` and press enter.

```sh
echo Hello world! # Hello world!
```

### Command Arguments and Options

You can pass arguments to the commands such you passed `Hello world!` to `echo` command. Commonly, the commands also have multiple options to be run with.

Probably the most common option is the option `--help` or `-h` that should help you with the command usage.

```sh
exit --help
# exit: exit [n]
#     Exit the shell.
#
#     Exits the shell with a status of N.  If N is omitted, the exit status
#     is that of the last command executed.
```

It is common there are two types of options.

* Single letter, starts with hyphen-minus character `-x`
* full text (no spaces), stars with double minus `--xxxx`

So the command structure look like this `command [-o | --options] [arguments]`.

### USE TAB AUTOCOMPLETION

Whenever, you press tab, the terminal autocomplete the word you are writing. If there is more than one posibility, nothing happens. Until you press tab twice.  Than it shows you the all the possible completions.

**It's unbelievable great feature**.

### USE SHELL HISTORY

It is a huge mistake to write commands more than once. Shell remembers what commands you have written, so you can just call them from the history. In case you used it as the previous command, press `[arrow up]`. In case you wrote it some commands ago, press `[ctrl-r]` and start typing, if the result is not what you want, you either press `[ctrl-r]` again for next match, or `[ecs]` to end the search.

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/231605/search-for-a-previous-command-with-the-prefix-i-just-typed[Search for a previous command with the prefix I just typed (unix.stackexchange.com)]

### Command Types

There are several command types:

|===
| Type       | Description

| builtin    | use `enable` or `compgen -b`
| executable | files in `/bin` or `/usr/bin`
| functions  | defined functions (by user)
| aliases    | concatenating more commands
| keyword    |
| unknown    |
|===

**command type[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/type.html]**

Let's check the type of the `echo` command.

```sh
type echo # echo is a shell builtin
```

Ok, `echo` is a built-in command. Can i find where it is?

```sh
# type command with option -a
type -a echo
# echo is a shell builtin
# echo is /bin/echo
```

**command enable, command compgen, command function, command alias, command unalias**

```sh
# To enable or disable shell builtins
enable
# List builtins
compgen -b

# Define function
function greet() { echo "hello"; }

# Create alias
alias my_alias='command_1; command_2'
# Destory alias
unalias
```

### More information about commands

**command help, command info, command man, command apropos**

Show appropriate manual pages for given TERM
```sh
man -k TERM     # Equivalent to command "apropos TERM"
```

### Expansions and suppressions

Not everything you write to shell is interpreted as you wrote it. Some characters are suppressed and others are expanded.

White space characters are suppressed.

```sh
echo   The   triple   spaces   are   shrinken   .
# The triple spaces are shrinken .
```

Some character such as tilda `~` are expanded.

```sh
echo ~
# /home/YOUR_USERNAME
```

There are various https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html[expansions] for now it is good to know this:

**"double quotes"** - prevents all suppressions and expansions except $ notations.

```
echo "~   $USER    ."
# ~   YOUR_USERNAME    .
```

**'single quotes'** - takes it as it is.

```
echo '~   $USER    .'
# ~   $USER    .
```

## Files and directories

### Paths

There is always a need to specify a path to the file a directory you want to work with.
The file can be a document you want to read, an image or simply anything.
Directory is a container for such a files and other directories.
Besides the files and directories the path may specify a command to be used.

There is already a xref:#linux-directory-structure[directory structure] by default.
Important is that there is one root directory, where every other directories are either in the root directory or nested into its subdirectories. Also every user has its own user directory.
At every point in a terminal you are in some directory.

|===
| Symbol | Path

| `/`    | The root directory.
| `D/DD` | `/` serves also as a directory separator.
| `~`    | Your home directory, usually `/home/YOUR_USER_NAME`
| `.`    | Your current directory.
| `..`   | Directory one above your current directory.
|===

```sh
# Show path to the current directory
pwd         # /home/USER/Desktop/DIR

# Show full path to directory or file.
realpath /  # /
realpath ~  # /home/USER
realpath .  # /home/USER/Desktop/DIR
realpath .. # /home/User/Desktop
```

Change the working Directory (`cd`)[https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html]

```sh
cd /home/username/path/to/the/directory

cd   # Plain cd moves to the home directory i.e. works same as cd ~
# Go to the previous directory.
cd - # same as: cd "$OLDPWD" && pwd
```

### Manipulation with files and directories

```sh
# Create new directory
mkdir NEW_DIRECTORY
mkdir -p ./path/to/end/dir # create every dir that does not exist on the path

# Copy files and directories
cp file1 file2  # Copy file1 to file2
cp -r dir1 dir2 # Copy all from dir1 to dir2

# Move file to another place
mv /old/path/to/file1 /new/path/to/file1
# Rename file1 as file2 and check if not overwriting
mv -i file1 file2
# Create new directory and put everything in
mv ./!(dir1) ./dir1/

# Rename directories tutorial_01,tutorial_02,tutorial_03 to t_01, t_02, t_03
for var in 0{1,2,3}; do mv tutorial_$var t_$var; done
# Replace space with underscore
for file in *; do mv "$file" `echo $file | tr ' ' '_'` ; done
# Add word before extension (file_whatever.png -> file_whatever_historical.png)
for file in *; do mv "$file" $(echo ${file%%.*}_historical.png); done

# Delete files and directories
rm file # Remove file
rm -r   # Remove directory (recursively with all files)
```

### Information about files, directories

**Commands: ls, tree, du, wc, stat**

```sh
# Shows all files of given directory
ls ./path/to/the/directory

# Show structure of all files and dictionaries from your dictionary
tree

# Shows counts of lines, words and bytes
wc FILE_NAME
# show number of lines (-l) words (-w) and bytes (-c)
wc -l FILE_NAME

# Recursively shows sizes (disk usage) of directories and files
du ./path/to/the/directory
# Show size of the DIRECTORY and its direct children (2 ~ levels down etc.)
du -d 1 ./path/to/the/DIRECTORY
# Display info in human readable form (-h) only for the top folder (-s)
du -hs FILE_NAME
# Display all file and directory sizes
du -a

# show file statistics
stat file1
```

### Compression and decompression

(Uploading and downloading in ohter way is **damn** slow)

**Command zip**

Zip files into new.zip

```sh
zip new file1 file2 file3
```

Unzip files from new.zip

```sh
unzip new.zip
# to NEW_DIR
unzip new.zip -d PATH/NEW_DIR
```

**Command tar**

Compress files to new.tar.gz

```sh
# -c = create
# -v = verbose
# -z = gzip / gz / zip
# -f = following files

tar -cvzf new.tar.gz file1 file2 file3
```

Decompress from new.tar.gz

```
# -x = extract

tar -xvzf oldFile.tar.gz
```
Decompress from new.tar.bz2

```
# -j = bz2
# -C = where to extract

tar -xvjf oldFile.tar.bz2 -C /path/Directory
```

* https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-extract-unzip-tar-bz2-file/[How to Extract (Unzip) Tar Bz2 File (linuxize.com)]

=== Links

**soft link**

Points to the original file, can be used as the original file for multiple purposes.

```sh
# Ways to create soft links
ln -s FILENAME LINKNAME
cp -s FILENAME LINKNAME
```

Example Usage
* I installed "code_like_hell" editor with the executable file at /usr/share/code_like_hell/bin/code_like_hell
* I want to open the editor just by typing `ch` to the terminal.
* So I create an symbolic link called `ch` at the `/usr/bin` directory.

```sh
ln -s /usr/share/code_like_hell/bin/code_like_hell /usr/bin/ch
```

**hard link**

Acts like a synchronized copy of the original file, change in one file changes the other.

```sh
# Hard link creations
ln FILENAME LINKNAME
cp -l FILENAME LINKNAME
```

=== Globbing and Wildcards

* [2.13. Pattern Matching Notation](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_13)

Glob patterns specify sets of filenames with wildcard characters. Wildcards are symbols with special meaning. It is especially useful when we don't know the exact name or if we perhaps want to use more than one name to do something.

```sh
# Question Mark
? # Matches one character within one directory.

# Single Asterisk
* # Matches zero or more characters within one directory.

# Double Asterisk
# TODO: only globstar only bash
** # Matches matches zero or more characters across multiple directories.

# Square Brackets Range
[a-dsu] # Matches one character from the range i.e. a,b,c,d,s,u
[3-7a-g]

# Square Brackets Group
[:digit:] # Equals to [0-9]
[:alpha:] # Equals to [a-zA-Z]
[:alnum:] # Equals to [0-9a-zA-Z]
[:upper:] # Equals to [A-Z]
[:lower:] # Equals to [a-z]

# Not containing anything from bracket
[!a] # Matches one character that is not letter a. Equivalent of [^ ] in RegEx.

# Examples
ls ?[[:digit:]]*
ls ?[4-6]
```

== sed

"The sed utility is a stream editor that shall read one or more text files, make editing changes according to a script of editing commands, and write the results to standard output. The script shall be obtained from either the script operand string or a combination of the option-arguments from the -e script and -f script_file options."
-- https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sed.html

"sed is a stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline). While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as ed), sed works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed’s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors."

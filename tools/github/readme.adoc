.Find Most Starred Projects by Language (Haskell example)
....
https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E1000&type=Repositories&l=Haskell&s=stars&o=desc
....

.Simple querying by language and sorting by stars does not work well.
[%collapsible]
====
* When language is in the query, most of the projects are missing, e.g.
`+https://github.com/search?q=language%3AHaskell&type=Repositories&s=stars&o=desc+`
* Google results gives you
https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories[most starred repositories]
which points to
`+https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories+`.
** Unfortunately querying projects with at least one star
and sorting them by the amount of stars does not work good either.
** E.g. following query gave for stars `+:>1+` and `+:>10000+` different results:
`+https://github.com/search?q=stars%3A%3E1&type=Repositories&l=Python&s=stars&o=desc+`

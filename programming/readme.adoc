* System languages
* Machine languages
* Extension languages
* Numerical analysis
* Concurrent languages

Execution::
* Compiled languages
* Interpreted languages

Syntax::
* Curly-bracket languages
* Off-side rule languages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm[Paradigm]::
* Multiparadigm languages
* Imperative languages
** Procedural languages
** Object-oriented class-based languages
* Declarative languages
** Functional languages
*** Purely-functional
** Logic-based languages
* Array languages
* Metaprogramming languages

Memory::
* Languages with manual memory management
* Garbage collected languages
* Type safe languages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system[Type Systems]::
* Strong or Weak

* Short-circuit evaluation

=== First-class Citizen

"In programming language design, a *first-class* citizen (also type, *object*, entity, or *value*) in a given programming language is an entity which supports all the operations generally available to other entities. These operations typically include being *passed as an argument*, *returned from a function*, and *assigned to a variable*."

Introduction
---
What is a Measure?
The notion started as a calculation an object size.
For lines and curves it is a length.
For surfaces it is possible to calculate an area.
On three-dimensional objects the volume can be measured.
In this article the concepts will be used in contemporary notation.
Having said the effort will be put on citing the original sources as much as possible.

Measures in the Pre-Calculus Period
---
Apparently measuring objects was a key ability since long ago.
One of the oldest record might be from old Egyptian civilisation around 3000 BC.
There on a Rhind papyrus were found approximately 20 solutions to object measurement problems[3].
An ancient Greeks knew irrational numbers in a form of incommensurable lengths.
It's discovery is credited to Pythagoreans[4].
They could also calculate a measure (e.g. area) by a convergence of approximations.
An object's measure was approximated by inscribing $n$ regular objects (e.g. polygons) of a known measure.
Such approximations were made for an increasing $n$ until they converged.
One example of this technique may be the Antiphon's Method of Exhaustion[5].
The progress related to measuring objects was slow until the end of the 16th century.
Then from the beginning of the 17th century numerous advancements were made.
Without going to a detail, here are some names of the most influential thinkers of that period.
Galileo Galilei, Johannes Kepler, Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, René Descartes, Bonaventura Cavalieri, Pierre de Fermat, Evangelista Torricelli, Blaise Pascal.

Invention of Calculus
---
* Newton and Leibniz
* Cauchy
* Riemann
    * 1866 Riemann integral published posthumously ???
* fundamental theorem of calculus

Foundations of Measure Theory

Set-Functions
---
* 1910 measurable sets as limits of indefinite integrals
    * Measure as countably additive set-functiuon of bounded variation
* 1913, J. Radon, the set-function does not need to have bounded variation
* 1915, M. Frechet, insted of Euclidean space, there can be any abstract space.
* Measure is any countably additive function defined on a $\sigma$-field of subsets of any space.

Differentiation
---
* 1905, G. Vitali, Vitali covering theorem
* 1910, Lebesgue extended his fundamental theorem of calculus from the real line to the euclidean spaces of higher dimensions.
* 1913, J. Radon extended it to other base masures than the Lebesgue measure.
* Vitali property
* If the derivative of F with respect to m is defined using a family H having the Vitali property, then F is absolutely continuous with respect to m if and only if the derivative f of F iwth respect to m exsists almost everywhere and F is the indefinite integral of f with respect to m.
* 1930, O. Nikodym, Radon-Nikodym derivative of F with respect to m.

Functional Analysis
---
* 1900s Hilbert spaces
* 1909 F. Riesz proved that any continuous linear functional L on the space of continuous functions on [0,1] can be represented as the integral with respect to some function of bounded variation f.
* Riesz Representation theorem.
* 1907 E. Fisher and F. Riesz showed that spaces of Integrable and square integrable functions known as L1, L2, have desirable convergence property known as completeness.
* 1933, S. Bochner initiated measures which assign to each set a vector in Banach space.

Harmonic Analysis
---
* 1822, Fourier series
* Replacing Riemann's integral with Lebesgue's let rose a field known as Harmonic Analysis
* 1933, A. haar, 1940's Haar measure.
* 1933 S. Bochner proved any Euclidean space the Fourier transform formula establishes a one-to-one correspondence between bounded positive measures and certain continuous functions  known as positive definite.

* Wiener measure.
* 1930-33 A. Kolmogorov laid the foundations of probability theory.
* Wiener measure together with pioneering work of Paul Levy in 1920-30's eventually led to birth of stochastic processes mainly established by J. L. Doob.

Ancient Greek philosophers made the great discovery of an axiomatic system.
So the theory can be based on axioms and further rules can be proven.

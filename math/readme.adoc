Expectation, E X = x_1*P(x_1) + ... + x_n*P(x_n) = Sum (i IN is) (x_i*P(x_i))

Covariance,  Cov (X, Y)              = E ((X - E X)*(Y - E Y))
Variance,    Var X = E ((X - E X)^2) = E ((X - E X)*(X - E X)) = Cov (X, X)

|a + a| = a + b <=> a > 0 And b > 0
|a - b| = a - b <=> a > 0 And b > 0 And a > b

|a + b| = |a| + |b| <=> a*b > 0
|a - b| = |a| - |b| <=> a*b > 0

|a + b| = |a| + |b|

.Partial function, total function
[quote,'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function']
____
a *partial function* f from a set X to a set Y is a function from a subset S of X (possibly the whole X itself) to Y. The subset S, that is, the domain of f viewed as a function, is called the domain of definition or natural domain of f. If S equals X, that is, if f is defined on every element in X, then f is said to be a *total function*.

____
Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from *open sets* (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of *countable union*, *countable intersection*, and *relative complement*.

For a topological space X, the collection of all Borel sets on X forms a σ-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel σ-algebra.

== Partial function, total function

.Partial function, total function
[quote,'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_function']
____
a *partial function* f from a set X to a set Y is a function from a subset S of X (possibly the whole X itself) to Y. The subset S, that is, the domain of f viewed as a function, is called the domain of definition or natural domain of f. If S equals X, that is, if f is defined on every element in X, then f is said to be a *total function*.

== Introduction

Technologies::
* ETL Tool - pentaho
* Database - PostgreSQL
* Reporting - Power BI

Business Intelligence::
    Set of *processes*, know-how, aplications and technologies.
    It enables to optimize processes, gather overview of business situation.
    It gives the business and edge over competition.

CAUTION: It's not about technologies.

Technology changes, the basic principle stays::
* Company collect data, if it can leverage them, it gives it an edge.
    * e.g. I know when you run out of a product, I send you a promo-code so you buys it again.

Data Warehouse Examples::
* Books
* SQL Database
* Excel sheets
* SQL Code

Data Warehouse::
* consistency and reliability.
* Often implemented as as big database.
* Often uses complicated code for measuring KPIs.
* Itself it is a project, someone must develop and maintain it.
* When done right, the information is transparent and auditable.

== Case Study

Company XYZ::
* new systems: ERP, CRM, SCM

*Digitalization*

Problems::
* Reporting - slow and dumb
* Data are not consolidated
* Product information are divergent
* It requires a lot of manual work

=== Data Integration

* Joining data tables

Data warehouse should model the business logic.
It transforms multiple data sources.

Excel has data connectors.
On update it reloads the data.

The raw data should never be in simple file e.g. Excel sheet, so the leaks are harder to do.

Business Definitions must be clear and transparent, so every entity agrees when calculated.

=== Reporting

To whom the report is made::
* user - sees details related to his field
* analytic - sees more information except the critically confidential
* manager - confindential information about fields he has responsibility
* controlling - excel with details
* director - very simple reports over all domains

Customer pathway (experience)::
* How the customer behaves on the website / in life.
* Customer Experience 360 - segmentation

Company evaluation based on data.

=== Prediction Models

* When the new technology pays off.
* When a specific machine breaks.
* Cluster analysis

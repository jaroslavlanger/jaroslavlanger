== Data Warehouse Architecture

* Source layer - inputs e.g. sap, excel
* Landing layer e.g. file system, or ETL (extract, transform, load)
* Database
    * Staging layer - raw data in database
    * Integrated layer (IDL) / target - clean, normalized data, consolidation
    * Access Layer - prepared data for special purposes, aggregations etc.
* Information delivery layer

== Integrated Data Layer Modeling

* It should model the underlying business, not fit the collected data.

Data Warehouse::
Information system, stores data from company information systems for analytical use in future.

Data Mart::
Exposed data (end-point of the data warehouse).

== Bill Inmon

* 1990 Building the Data Warehouse
* Top Down
* Waterfall
* Better for long-term big projects.

== Ralph Kimball

* Dimensional modeling
* Defined historization data (SCD)
** Slowly changing dimension.
* Better for quick solutions for small things.
* Until 12 Data marts it is the more profitable.

== Data Vault

"All the data, all the time".

Data are just stored, no afterwards manipulation is allowed.

* 1995 first unpublished talk.
* 2010 The Business of Data Vault modelling
* 2015 Building a scalable data warehouse with data vault 2.0 (TOP!)

....

* Data Lineage - from Delivery automatically returns source information.

=== Source systems

* Definition of time slots.
* Linked server.
* API

=== Landing Layer

* Full Load or Increment or Delta
* First layer interacts with the database.
* Change data capture (CDC)
** Kafka - captures data about such events.

=== Data Base

*Stage Layer*

* Validation of data before the target.

*Integrated Core Target*

* 3NF Norm
* No business logic
* Historization
* Easily over billion lines
* Slowly changing dimension
** SCD0
** SCD1
** SCD2

*Semantic Layer*

* Source of ground truth.
* Serves as separation of inherent and business properties.
* This layer is optional but highly recommended.
* View
* Contains set of Datamarts.
** Datamart

_Dimensional Modeling_

* Factual table
* Dimensional table
* Factual table contains numbers NOT averages, not sums.
* Schemes
** Star scheme, all dimensions are linked to one fact.
** Snowflake, links between dimension tables.
** Snow storm - more fact tables in one.
* Dimension can't have facts!

=== Delivery Layer

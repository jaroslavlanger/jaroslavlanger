"Power Query (Get & Transform) and Power Pivot complement each other. Power Query is the recommended experience for importing data. Power Pivot is great for modeling the data youâ€™ve imported. Use both to shape your data in Excel so you can explore and visualize it in PivotTables, PivotCharts, and Power BI."

"A core capability of Power Query is to filter and combine, that is, to mash-up data from one or more of a rich collection of supported data sources. Any such data mashup is expressed using the Power Query M Formula Language. It's a functional, case sensitive language similar to F#."

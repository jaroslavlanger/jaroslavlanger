"AsciiDoc appears strikingly similar to Markdown, making way for an easy transition. Where AsciiDoc shines is in its depth. AsciiDoc provides all the essential elements in technical writing out of the box. No variants needed. Its syntax can be elaborated without having to fundamentally change the language, assuring users that itâ€™s still standard AsciiDoc."

Look at the link:asciidoc.adoc[source] to understand the magic.

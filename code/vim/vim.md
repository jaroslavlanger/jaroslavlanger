* To enter the insert mode press `[i]`.
* Press `[esc]` to exit the insert mode.

**Visual mode**

* Visual mode enables to visually select the text and apply editing to the selection.
* To enter the visual mode press `v`.
* Press `[esc]` to exit the visual mode.

**Command mode**

* Command mode allows you to use advanced commands such as replacing text with regex.
    * It also allows you to set up the editor e.g. set search to be case insensitive.
* To enter the command mode press `:`.

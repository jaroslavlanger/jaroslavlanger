<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, imagine you need something from a person and you call them.
Start the call by saying what you need to say first.
Don&#8217;t fool them around so you can later sneak it in.
Just say "Hi, Person&#8217;s Name, can you do That for me?"
Then you can carry on with the nice stuff for as long as you want.
The point is, you shouldn&#8217;t put more pressure on a person by sugar-coating them first.
So the other person can decide for themselves.
If they decide to do it without pressure from you, they&#8217;ll probably feel good about it.
On the other hand, if you make them do it, they&#8217;re probably not going to like it very much.
If you&#8217;re being manipulated, you might not know it right away, but you&#8217;ll know it eventually.
Because if you&#8217;re doing something you don&#8217;t want to do, you will know it.
That&#8217;s just the other person&#8217;s point of view.
With this approach, you can be rejected more often.
However, your relationship with others will be much better.</p>

<p>A lot of your emotions are the result of your imperfectly balanced hormonal system.
Naturally, you come up with many reasons and explanations for having them.
Start by accepting them.
Once you&#8217;re okay with your emotions, start thinking about them, not before.</p>

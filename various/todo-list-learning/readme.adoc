Approach how to spend your learning time based on your priorities.

== Priority TODO List

Whenever I want to learn a thing I start by creating an empty document about it.

. Create a TODO section in the document.
** *Keep this list ordered by your priorities*.
** *Any time you add something or you priorities change, reorder it accordingly*.

. Add the concepts you want to learn to the list (_ordered by your priorities_).

. Take first item from the list and act according to its type:
.. A specific resource or task -> study it / do it.
.. General concept / idea -> explore it.
*** E.g. type it to the browser and read first five links.
*** Don't spend too much time on it, the purpose is to find good resources.
*** Trying to explore and study at the same time is often counterproductive. 
**** *You want to spend your time on the most prioritized stuff not the newest.*

. Don't change the topic (e.g. website) while exploring or studying.
** When you meet something you need to explore further, insert it to the list.

=== TODO list is not grouped by topics!
Perhaps some topic may have high priority in terms of general understanding,
but the priority of its details may be very low.

=== Be lazy in terms of your own writing!
In case you find a perfect study resource, just use it.

=== Choose wisely what's worth your efforts, don't reinvent the wheel!
Apart from practicing there are two good reasons to do something.

. The thing you want doesn't exist.
. You think you can do noticeably better than what's already there.

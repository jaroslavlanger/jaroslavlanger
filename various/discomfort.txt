                                Discomfort

After few days of the other kind, this was the mania one.
Everything just felt good morning to evening.
Hardest dessert to make at the minute of closing was for me a piece of cake.

Happy walk home,
hard yoga session,
more progress then ever,
new hand-stand ability, what else.

Then came the shower time.
The moment of truth.

>>> Three weeks ago

Man in a video said:
"the way to gain flexibility is to stretch the part to the discomfort
and stay there for some time..."
and I was like, hell, this is probably it.
Learning anything was always painful,
reading was painful, dancing, programming, climbing, running, volleyball, yoga
all is about pain.
What about the cold-resistance shouldn't i give it a chance?

??? halloooo!!! I am freaking cold all the * time...
My legs are cold 24/7 I HATE COLD!!!
Ok, no need to rush, i might find a way to pass it through somehow...

So i went to the bathroom and this followed...

Me the man: Okey, we don't need to do it if it will be unpleasant...

Me the dog: Okey, just don't do it.

m: Just wash your hands, they are used to cold water.
d: Ok, hands are ok.

m: ...and feet
d: ...feet ok

m: and the legs with it
d: ... i don't like it

m: c'mon, just legs
d: ...

m: up to the belly...
d: I REALLY DON'T LIKE THIS

m: just the legs all the way up and that's it
d: ok legs, fine

...

m: and shoulders
d: okey shoulders are fine
...
d: I HATE THIS
...
d: I am not going to put there either my belly, butt or back, forget about it!
...
m: let's shower the head, you are used to cold water before the haircut thing..
d: fine
...
m: so let's just wash once again what is already wet and we are done.

d: you know i really don't want to do this
d: i don't enjoy it
d: i want to stop it right now!

m: don't worry, it will end soon
d: ...

m: see, when you are up the legs, you can do full circle behind
m: it's not gonna be worse than it already is...
d: ...

m: good boy
d: ...

m: now when you do the shoulders, connect them across the back as well...
d: I HATE THIS!

m: good, now when you have the head under water...
m: ...step forward and let the water fell down your back
d: ...

m: GOOD JOB, your full body is was now washed with a cold water
d: i hate this, promise me we not gonna do it again

m: sure, now take the soap and repeat it with it...
d: i hate this so much!!!
...
d: now it's actually much simpler then before
...
d: but it's still very cold, i don't wanna do it again
...
d: it actually wasn't that baaad...
...
d: but i definitely don't wanna do it again
...
d: preferably...

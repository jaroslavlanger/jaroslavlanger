# Tabu search for SAT

## Abstract

SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) is an NP-hard problem without a one superior solution.
In this project I experimented with solving SAT instances using Tabu Search.
Results were measured on X different sets with over Y instances.
Based on the results of the measurements I consider Tabu Search an viable
approach for NP-hard problems.

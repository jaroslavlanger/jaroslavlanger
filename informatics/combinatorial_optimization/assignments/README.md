# Assignments

Assignments from combinatorial optimization course at FIT CTU, Prague. Different solvers for the 0/1 Knapsack problem.

Jaroslav Langer

## 1. Exact methods for the knapsack problem

Write a program to solve decision knapsack problem. Create two implementations: "brute force" and "branch and bound".

## 2. Exact and Heuristic Approaches for the Constructive Optimization Knapsack Problem

## 3. Experimental Measurements of Algorithms Quality

## 4. Local Search for Knapsack Problem

## TODO

- Remove trailing spaces from `./data`.
